== SV-DV Env

`svDV` is a SystemVerilog-UVM based Env.

* Sequence based stimiulus
* UVM_PHASES & UVM_OBJECTION

contain generic component ready to reuse. +
containing:

* common defines

Enable advanced logging capabilities+
Base UVM reporting mechanaizem is missing features - making it not flexiable enough.

This infrastrucure provieds:
* *sv_logger_control*
** Selective Log Seperation Control
*** select logfile based on MSG-ID
** Selective Verbosity Control
*** Verbosity threshold based on MSG-ID
* *sv_virtual_report_server*
** Selective Reporting Formatter
*** ability to set multiple report_server

== Methodologies

* Logging methodology
** Meaning full prints
** Error Msg
** Verbosity control & Selective verbosity control
** Selective Log Seperation
* Coverage & Configurable Coverage
** Configurable Coverage - key for reuse
** Enum in Coverage
** Transition Coverage
* Stage randomization
* Flag Object, State Object, Test Object
* SV_CREATE - intreducing dynamic factory bypass
* TI, TB, assertions, forces, connection to DE
* TLM vs uvm_event
* Randomization & Constaint
** Avoid doing randomization functions!
** Constraints on Base classes should be only legalty constraints
* Generation - Sequenced based generation
** Interface sequences
** Pkt\Trans Virtual sequence - implementing protocol
** Delay in sequences - not in Agent
** Randomization in sequences
** Sequences uese p_sequencer.penv.config for configuration oriated generation
* asssert, sequene, assume, cover, check, property

=== Type of issues

. Parametrization issues - mainly arround uvm_sequencer
. std::randomize() - not working
. uvm_do_on - not working
. uvm_do_with - not working


== Education:

. program vs module
. design
. clocking block & mod ports
. bind interfaces
. event, uvm_event, uvm_event_pool
. dump waves
